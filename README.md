# 🚌 BTRACK  🛰️🌍


Our innovative concept revolves around offering offline bus tracking using GSM-GPS technology, alongside a suite of complementary services. Our approach of bus management and safty features are what that sets us apart. Let's get to know about it in depth:

## 🌐 Tracking System: A9G GSM GPS + ESP32 + Adafruit API

A cutting-edge bus tracking system that combines hardware and cloud services for real-time monitoring and offline tracking to avoid any problem caused due to fluctuation of internet:

### Hardware Components:

1. 📡 **A9G GSM GPS Module:** Integrates GSM and GPS functions, sending location data to ESP32 via serial communication.

2. 💻 **ESP32 Development Board:** Collects GPS data, manages communication, and interacts with components.

### Workflow:

1. 🛰️ **GPS Data Acquisition:**
   - A9G gathers GPS coordinates.
   - Sends data to ESP32 through serial communication.

## 🌟 Integration of Multiple Services

Our platform provides a combination of paramount services, which makes our user experience remarkable. From offline bus tracking to route optimization, attendance management, driver identification, safety alerts, and routine checkup features, we offer a comprehensive solution that covers all aspects of bus management. Unlike other solutions that might provide only a subset of these services, we ensure that every bus operation is adressed efficiently and effectively.

## ⛽ Stop  Optimization (Fuel and Time Optimization)

One of our standout features is the ability to optimize routes based on real-time data, in simple words the route of bus automatically gets optimized on the basis of student absent that day, our algorithm automatically eliminate the stop of absentees using biometics addendence and mapped data and displayes the shortest route. By adjusting routes in such manner, we aim to save fuel consumption and reduce travel time maintaining sustainability. This unique feature not only emphasizes our commitment to cost savings but also underscores our dedication to environmental sustainability.

## 🚦 Driver Drowsiness Alarm

Safety is paramount in our solution, and we go the extra mile to ensure both passengers and drivers are well-protected. One of our important services include drivers drowziness alert, it is a safety feature that sets off the alaram as soon as the system detects fatigue and in addition to that the circuit breaks off automatically reducing the speed of bus gradually, reducing the intensity of accident. This approach to driver safety differentiates us by prioritizing the well-being of all individuals on the road.

In a crowded field, our Offline Bus Tracking and Management System stands out as a comprehensive, efficient, and safety-conscious solution that caters to the diverse needs of modern bus management.
